# Comparative-analysis-Early_1990s-Q3_2023-recession
<p>In this project, I and my group perform a comparative analysis on the Early 1990's and Expected 2Q2023 Recession through data visualization.</p> 
<p>We use evidence from the U.S. market.</p>
<p><b>PROJECT BAKCGROUND</b></p>
<p>Acccording to Fitch Ratings, Inc. (2022):
<br>- U.S. economy to enter genuine recession territory — albeit relatively mild by historical standards — in 2Q23.
<br>- The projected recession is quite similar to that of 1990–1991, which followed similarly rapid Fed tightening in 1989–1990.
<br>- Nevertheless, downside risks stem from nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratios, which are much higher now than in the 1990s.</p>
<p><b>PROJETC AIMS</p></b>
<p>Observing potential recession risks by means of comparative analysis on leading financial and  microeconomic indicators prior to the Early 1990’s and Expected 2Q23’s recession.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</p></b>
<p><b>Decision Makers</b>
• There are some similarities and unsimilarities between the two contributing 
conditions prior to recession in Early 1990’s and 2Q23
• The analysis herein highlights how financial, leading indicator, and other 
macroeconomic variables provide different signals regarding the risk of a recession.
<p><b>Retail Investors</b>
• Historically, buying stocks during a downturn has been very profitable, but many 
investors are not comfortable doing it.
• Selling put options during a downturn can be a viable alternative to buying stocks.
• The high volatility of bear markets makes selling options more profitable than usual.
• Less-experienced investors should only sell puts on stocks that they would want to 
own.
• This type of strategy has been successful enough that put-selling exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs) are now available for the S&P 500.
