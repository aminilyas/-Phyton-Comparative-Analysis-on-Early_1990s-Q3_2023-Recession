# Comparative Analysis of Early 1990's and Expected 2Q2023's Recession through Data Visualization
<p>In this project, I and my group perform a comparative analysis on the Early 1990's and Expected 2Q2023 Recession through data visualization.</p> 
<p>We use evidence from the U.S. market.</p>
<p><b>PROJECT BAKCGROUND</b></p>
<p>Acccording to Fitch Ratings, Inc. (2022):
<br>- U.S. economy to enter genuine recession territory — albeit relatively mild by historical standards — in 2Q23.
<br>- The projected recession is quite similar to that of 1990–1991, which followed similarly rapid Fed tightening in 1989–1990.
<br>- Nevertheless, downside risks stem from nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratios, which are much higher now than in the 1990s.</p>
<p><b>PROJETC AIMS</p></b>
<p>Observing potential recession risks by means of comparative analysis on leading financial and  microeconomic indicators prior to the Early 1990’s and Expected 2Q23’s recession.</p>
<p><b>PROJECT STORIES</p></b>
<b>- Story 1:</b> A comparative analysis on key indicators (currency, prices of S&P500, and Oil) during the historical circumstances contributed to the recession in the period:1989-1990 (OLD)AND 2021-2022 (NEW).
<br><b>- Story 2:</b> During the two periods (OLD and NEW) contributing to recessions: (1) How do industries in the U.S. evolve over time?, (2) Which industries 
show higher stock returns?, (3) Can the industry level stock return differences be explained by the differences in industry characteristics?
<br><b>- Story 3.1:</b> During the two periods (OLD and NEW) contributing to recessions: (1) Do stock returns move together with macroeconomic variables?, (2) Do all industry stock returns show the same level of sensitivity?, (3) Which macroeconomic variable is the stronger driver of the stock returns?
<br><b>- Story 3.2:</b> During the two periods (OLD and NEW) contributing to recessions, how do the financial and macroeconomic indicators predict the probability of recession Rrisk?
<br><b>- Story 4:</b> A. To explore the following across strikes and maturities of SPX, NDX, XEO: (1) The option value—implied volatility, (2) The sensitivity measures—the Greeks, (3) Trading activities—Volume and Open Interest, (4) Transaction costs—Bid-Ask spread, (5) Whether the above quantities differ by calls/puts; B. To provide comparative analysis for risk management through hedging.

<p><b>CONCLUSION</p></b>
<p><b>Decision Makers</b>
• There are some similarities and unsimilarities between the two contributing 
conditions prior to recession in Early 1990’s and 2Q23
• The analysis herein highlights how financial, leading indicator, and other 
macroeconomic variables provide different signals regarding the risk of a recession.
<p><b>Retail Investors</b>
• Historically, buying stocks during a downturn has been very profitable, but many 
investors are not comfortable doing it.
• Selling put options during a downturn can be a viable alternative to buying stocks.
• The high volatility of bear markets makes selling options more profitable than usual.
• Less-experienced investors should only sell puts on stocks that they would want to 
own.
• This type of strategy has been successful enough that put-selling exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs) are now available for the S&P 500.
